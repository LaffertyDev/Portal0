My Webserver

This is my personal NodeJs webserver. In particular, I wanted to host a few things here:

- Links to all relevant projects
- Brief descriptions and summaries of my projects
- A Blog (that I may or may not write in)
- Hosting area for my Dungeons and Dragons content
- Relevant tools that I have created to make my life easier
- Completely move away from LinkedIn as my professional area (why use a linkedin as a web developer? seems awful)

## Design Considerations

1. Mobile friendly
2. Try to use as few packages as possible*
3. Attempt to design and build website without using a template
4. Attempt to build things using my new core paradigms, good coding styles, and clean html/css
5. Maintain documentation and workflows as I build the website, instead of pushing them off

> Notable Exceptions are MongoDb, Express, Angular, and Nodejs (MEAN)

## Reasoning

1. So I can learn more fundamentals of web technologies first and foremost
2. Improve my design skills with hands-on experience

## Installed Packages

- NodeJs
- AngularJs
- Express
- Sass
